📌 Project Overview

The Step Progress Bar visually guides users through a five-step process using circular indicators and "Previous" and "Next" buttons for navigation. 

This project enhances skills in DOM manipulation, dynamic UI updates, and responsive design using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no libraries or frameworks involved.

✨ Features Implemented

   ✔️ Progress Bar with 5 Steps

   ✔️ Each step is represented by a circle displaying its step number.

   ✔️ Active steps turn green with a checkmark (✔️).

   ✔️ Inactive steps remain grey with a cross (❌).

   ✔️ Navigation Buttons:

"Previous" button disabled on the first step.

"Next" button disabled on the last step.

   ✔️ Buttons correctly enable/disable as per navigation state.
   
   ✔️ JavaScript dynamically manages current step, active class toggling, and button states.
